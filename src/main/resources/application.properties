Achieve key strategic projects and deliver key capabilities 
•	SSH Algorithm changes on all platform servers for PCI compliance implemented with no impact to test team stakeholders.
•	Applet removal patch, Oracle TAC changes, sequences reset changes, Active MQ changes were deployed on all preprod regions and ensuring all tests done before prod releases.
•	JBOSS upgrade on all preprod regions with option to switch versioning to maintain like prod until production upgrade
•	RHEL upgrade/downgrade on platform owned servers for testing scenarios with product patches and debugging issues and certification performed, PCI patching on platform servers was done.
•	DSL Transfer mock and golive planning, procedural implementation of the executions tasks from platform support is followed.
•	Took responsibility of maintaining the technology hygiene of platform servers to make sure Finacle platform is complaint.
•	Onboarding of passwords to PPM, keys to Vault done
•	Triaging calls setup for troubleshooting batch performance issues.
•	Leanix/sysdocs documentation
Deliver an exceptional, reliable experience to our customers 
•	Few new capabilities from platform team were developed including infra-automation capabilities as part of patching, reboots recurring cycles.
•	Implemented Hashing process validation notification and optimization.
•	Onboarding of PA regions to datadog with default APM
•	As per CICD trident guidelines, keys onboarding and maintenance in vault, respective changes in all platform org pipelines
•	BAU processes of releases, patch deployments, environment refreshes, jre, java upgrades, os patching, adhoc issue support etc
•	Input, ideas provided for enhancing the CLS log information with required stack traces published.
•	Contributed for datadog enablement with ESM tools team, vendor and contractors.
•	Reboot validation report for preprod regions is updated with all agents, mounts, services, versions, softlinks etc for easy monitoring from platform team before and after patchings, upgrades/downgrades etc
•	Pipeline for Release region and Production common.env comparison report, to ensure all configs are included in the release.
•	Access restriction of platform super users done for team for avoiding any issues
•	New use cases for enhancing the self-service capabilities like .so file deployment pipeline, coreauto user unlock, Util files execution implemented.
•	Finacle restart jobs, ensured team uses online automated process by triggering the pipeline with and additional validation for batch process check added, to abort services stop when batch in progress
•	Config syncup activity in all env like as of prod
•	Monitor for validation of sequences after the DB refresh is added and alert for any mismatch.
•	Code comparison pipeline in implemented for dev regions as well, to check for any scripts, files differences for debugging any issue.
Develop software that creates value for our customers 
•	As part of BOT changes, approval name persistence, dev areas addition for allowing self service capabilities, transaction tables DDL approval
•	Removing pid files, core batch jobs for DM regions, user unlock, util file executions, so file deployments enabled.
•	Dashboard is now enhanced with very useful features of certificate status info on all regions, ensuring actual cert status from environment, by pushing expiry details from server to dashboard.
•	Environmental refresh details added dashboard, for dev and test teams to know the code base on the region they are on.
•	Environment details for various agent’s status, versions, soft links, partitions from server are now pushed to dashboard in real time.
•	Patch list publisher on daily basis for files deployed in ESQM regions, to identity if any issues arise
•	Monitors developed for generic user id access in ESQM environments to avoid any issues.
•	Space clearing and alerting, log retention configuration, periodic scanning of partitions
•	Filesystem cleanup, certificate cleanup of expired, duplicates, log archival parameterization
•	backups cleanup strategy defined, and scripts automated.
•	Catchpoint monitoring implemented for ESQM and PA region sso login, for checking sanity of environment.
•	InfyDrive certificate expiry alerting
Enable technology as a strategic capability via an employee-first workforce strategy 
•	Trackers documented and followed for various issues, fixes, patches, for environment wise sync up and testing,  to outline any manual work for any of the RITMs
•	KT provided for the team with design and pseudo/sample code for enhancements on platform, specifically for predominators.
•	Reliance on contracts reduced by ensuring no manual work on the servers, instead required change, RITM, automation, pipelines and specifically bot are utilized.
•	Detailed steps documented for upgrade/downgrade which necessary checklists, DSL transfer executions, certificate renewal process
•	Jira housekeeping for ProdGenies and Predominators is being done, with updates, cleanup and by actively maintaining user story boards with detailed updates of respective tasks, activities being performed as part of various initiatives.
•	Release notes uploaded to nexus with a pipeline, for track of various product patches and steps.
For Risks as mentioned in the risk goal
•	All the assigned Risks, Vulnerabilities, Violations to platform team are remediated, resolved by making sure the required updates/upgrades are done on all the platform owned servers.
•	Cycode violations are proactively monitored, and fixes are reviewed, 96% of violations were closed within 2 weeks after reported.
•	As part of a security risk MFA is implemented in addition to call alter on production servers and preprod regions where prod data is not scrubbed.
•	Best security approaches of maintaining the pem, tokens, keys, urls are maintained in the vault to avoid any security risks.
•	Alternate tools or approaches designed and implemented, in case of any vulnerability/risk of any unsupported version
•	Proactively pointed out the hardcoded block of code, passwords, personal access tokens for moving to AAP credentials or vault in platform org repo
